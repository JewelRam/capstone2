Welcome to BitchAbout! An app for complaining! You come here to vent and watch you list of personal baggage grow and hopefully shrink over time!

Steps for using:

1. Clone down the capstone2 repo

2. Then CD into the directory and Start BitchAbout.sln

3. You will need to update the appsettings.json to have your computer's adress

4. This will bring you into Visual Studio, make sure the database is set up in the Object Explorer and if it is, simply hit ISS Express and that will start the app.

5. If the database needs to be rebuilt, double check its been deleted and run dotnet restore, then run update-database

   When the app starts you will be brought to the Home page where you create your rants. Once you've created one you will be brought to your "baggage" where you can either do actions for being "still pissed" or "over it"
